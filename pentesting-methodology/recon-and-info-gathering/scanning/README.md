# Passive Recon

In our case 'passive' means not sending packets directly to the service.

### Visit the website

### Whois

### Basic DNS Resolution

Resolve the DNS

```text
root@kali:~$ host <domain>
root@kali:~$ nslookup <domain>
```

If we only have an IP address, we can use whois

```text
root@kali:~$ whois <ip>
```

### Netcraft

Most of the info found on [netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com) is not unique. It is basic whois info. But one thing is really good, it lists the different IP-addresses the page has had over the years. This can be a good way to **bypass cloudflare** and other services that hide the real IP. Using netcraft we can find the IP that was in use before they implemented cloudflare.

Another detail that is good to know is the **hosting-company** or **domain-provider**. Those details can be used if we want to try some **social-engineering or spear-phishing attack**.
