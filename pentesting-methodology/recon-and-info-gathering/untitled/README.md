# Active Recon

Once information has been gathered during the passive phase, it is not time to move to the active recon phase.

## Netdiscover

This tool is used to scan a network for live machines

```text
root@kali:~$ netdiscover -r <cidr>
```

## Ping Sweep

We can also use nmap to do a host live check

```text
root@kali:~$ nmap -sn <host>
```

## Masscan can also be used

```text
root@kali:~$ masscan -e <iface> --ports U:0-65535,0-65535 --rate 800 -oL <file> <cidr>
```
